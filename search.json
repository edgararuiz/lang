    "text": "Use an LLM to translate a function’s help documentation on-the-fly. lang overrides the ? and help() functions in your R session. If you are using RStudio or Positron, the translated help page will appear in the usual help pane.\nIf you are a package developer, lang helps you translate your documentation, and to include it as part of your package. lang will use the same ? override to display your translated help documents.\n\n\nTo install the GitHub version of lang, use:\ninstall.packages(\"pak\")\npak::pak(\"edgararuiz/lang\")\n\n\n\nIf you have not used mall yet, then the first step is to set it up. Feel free to follow the instructions in that package’s Get Started page. Setting up your LLM and mall should be a one time process.\nOn an every day R session, you’ll just need to load lang and then tell it which model to run using llm_use():\nlibrary(lang)\n\nllm_use(\"ollama\", \"llama3.2\", seed = 100)\nAfter that, simply use ? to trigger and display the translated documentation. During translation, lang will display its progress by showing which section of the documentation is currently translating:\n&gt; ?lm\nTranslating: Title\nIf your environment is set to use the Spanish language, the help pane should display this:\n\nR enforces the printed name of each section, so they cannot be translated. So titles such as Description, Usage and Arguments will always remain untranslated.\n\n\nAs you can imagine, the quality of translation will mostly depend on the LLM being used. This solution is meant to be as helpful as possible, but acknowledging that at this stage of LLMs, only a human curated translation will be the best solution. Having said that, I believe that even an imperfect translation could go a long way with someone who is struggling to understand how to use a specific function in a package, and may also struggle with the English language.\n\n\n\nIf the original English help page displays, check your environment variables:\nSys.getenv(\"LANG\")\n#&gt; [1] \"en_US.UTF-8\"\nSys.getenv(\"LANGUAGE\")\n#&gt; [1] \"\"\nIn my case, lang recognizes that the environment is set to English, because of the en code in the variable. If your LANG variable is set to en_... then no translation will occur.\nIf this is your case, set the LANGUAGE variable to your preference. You can use the full language name, such as ‘spanish’, or ‘french’, etc. You can use Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = \"[my language]\"), or, for a more permanent solution, add the entry to your your .Renviron file (usethis::edit_r_environ()).\n\n\n\n\nThe language that the help documentation will be translated to, is determined by one of the following two environment variables. In order of priority, the variables are:\n\nLANGUAGE\nLANG\n\nIt is likely that your LANG variable already defaults to your locale. For example, mine is set to: en_US.UTF-8 (That means English, United States). For someone in France, the locale would be something such as fr_FR.UTF-8. Llama3.2, recognizes these UTF locales, and using lang, calling ? will result in translating the function’s help documentation into French.\nIt uses the mall package as the integration point with the LLM. Under the hood, it runs llm_vec_translate() multiple times to translate the most common sections of the help documentation (e.g.: Title, Description, Details, Arguments, etc.). If lang determines that your environment is set to use English, it will simply display the original documentation.\n\n\n\nYou may want to provide translations of your documentation as part of your package.lang includes an entire infrastructure to help you to do the following:\n\nLet the LLM take the first pass at translating your documentation\nEasily edit the translations. This means, either you, or a collaborator, can fine tune the new files\nInclude the translated Rd files as part of your package\nHave ? and help() pull from your translated documents\n\n\n\nWhile inside your package’s project, use translate_roxygen() to have lang translate all of your documentation to the desired language. The function call must include the target language, and the sub-folder to save the translated files to:\ntranslate_roxygen(\"spanish\", \"es\")\nThat function call will iterate through your ‘R/’ folder and translate all of your roxygen2 documentation. The new Roxygen documents will be saved, by default, to a new ‘man-lang/’ folder. Make sure to add the new folder to your project ‘.Rbuildignore’ file (^man-lang$)\nISO 639 codes - The name of the sub-folder to use needs to be the two letter designation of the target language you are using. That is why we used es for Spanish. For the list of codes, you can refer to the Wikipedia page here.\nFor this package, making that function call creates this console output:\n&gt; translate_roxygen(\"spanish\", \"es\")\n\n── `lang` translating Roxygen into 'spanish' \nℹ Loading lang\n[1/7] R/help-shims.R --&gt; man-lang/es/help-shims.R\n[2/7] R/lang-help.R --&gt; man-lang/es/lang-help.R\n[3/7] R/lang.R --&gt; [Skipping, no content]\n[4/7] R/mall-reexports.R --&gt; man-lang/es/mall-reexports.R\n[5/7] R/process-roxygen.R --&gt; man-lang/es/process-roxygen.R\n[6/7] R/translate-roxygen.R --&gt; man-lang/es/translate-roxygen.R\n[7/7] R/utils.R --&gt; [Skipping, no content]\nlang ties the resulting translated R scripts to the source R scripts by adding a copy of the original Roxygen documentation. This way, it avoids re-translating the content if nothing has changed:\n&gt; translate_roxygen(\"spanish\", \"es\")\n\n── `lang` translating Roxygen into 'spanish' \nℹ Loading lang\n[1/7] R/help-shims.R --&gt; [Skipping, no changes]\n[2/7] R/lang-help.R --&gt; [Skipping, no changes]\n[3/7] R/lang.R --&gt; [Skipping, no content]\n[4/7] R/mall-reexports.R --&gt; [Skipping, no changes]\n[5/7] R/process-roxygen.R --&gt; [Skipping, no changes]\n[6/7] R/translate-roxygen.R --&gt; [Skipping, no changes]\n[7/7] R/utils.R --&gt; [Skipping, no content]\n\n\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, lang translates the functions’ Roxygen comments. This approach allows you as the developer to easily edit the output.\nFor the lang_help() function, in the ‘R/lang-help.R’ script, the top of the documentation looks like this:\n#' Translates help\n#' @description\n#' Translates a given topic into a target language. It uses the `lang` argument\n#' to determine which language to translate to. If not passed, this function will\n#' look for a target language in the LANG and LANGUAGE environment variables to\n#' determine the target language. If the target language is English, no translation\n#' will be processed, so the help returned will be the original package's\n#' documentation.\n#'\n#' @param topic The topic to search for\n#' @param package The R package to look for the topic\n#' @param lang Language to translate the help to\n#' @param type Produce \"html\" or \"text\" output for the help. It default to\n#' `getOption(\"help_type\")`\n...\nAnd this is what the translation in ‘man-lang/es/lang.R’ looks like:\n#' Ayuda en traducción\n#' @description La función traduce un tema dado a un idioma objetivo. Utiliza\n#' el argumento `lang` para determinar qué idioma traducir. Si no se pasa, esta\n#' función busca un idioma objetivo en las variables de entorno LANG y LANGUAGE\n#' para determinarlo. Si el idioma objetivo es inglés, no se procesa la\n#' traducción, por lo que se devuelve la documentación original del paquete.\n#' @param topic  El tema de búsqueda principal.\n#' @param package  Paquete R para buscar el tema.\n#' @param lang  Please provide the text you'd like me to translate.\n#' @param type  Utilice \"html\" o \"texto\" como salida para la ayuda, de lo\n#' contrario se utilizará el valor por defecto de `getOption(\"help_type\")`.\n...\nEditing an R scripts Roxygen comments is a lot easier than editing an Rd file, additionally, this solution integrates better with the usual package development process.\nIt also opens the possibility to have collaborators to submit PRs to your package’s repository with edits to the translation, or even submit brand new translations.\n\n\n\nThe Rd help files are still the best way for R to process and display your help files. The second, and final step, will be to have lang create the Rd files based on the translated Roxygen comments, simply run:\nprocess_roxygen()\nThat function will iterate through all the language sub-folders in ‘man-lang/’ to process the Rd files. The resulting Rd files will be saved to ‘inst/man-lang/’. Please keep in mind that this step does not need an LLM to work. It is only creating the Rd files, and putting them in the correct location.\nUnder the hood, lang creates temporary copies of your package, replaces the scripts in the ‘R’ folder with your translations, and then runs the roxygen2::roxygenize() function. This ensures that the Rd creation is as close as possible as if you were running devtools::document() during your package development.\nFor this package, making that function call creates this console output:\n&gt; process_roxygen()\n\n── Creating Rd files for 'es' \n- ./inst/man-lang/es/help.Rd\n- ./inst/man-lang/es/lang_help.Rd\n- ./inst/man-lang/es/process_roxygen_folder.Rd\n- ./inst/man-lang/es/reexports.Rd\n- ./inst/man-lang/es/translate_roxygen.Rd\nAs an additional aid, lang will compare the Roxygen documentation in your current ‘R/’ folder, with the copy of the documentation made at the time of translation. If there are differences, lang will show you a warning indicating that a given translation may be out of date:\n&gt; process_roxygen()\n! The following R documentation has changed, translation may need to be revised:\n|- R/translate-roxygen.R -x-&gt; man-lang/es/translate-roxygen.R\n\n── Creating Rd files for 'es' \n- ./inst/man-lang/es/help.Rd\n- ./inst/man-lang/es/lang_help.Rd\n- ./inst/man-lang/es/process_roxygen_folder.Rd\n- ./inst/man-lang/es/reexports.Rd\n- ./inst/man-lang/es/translate_roxygen.Rd\n\n\n\nThe end-user can easily access your translations by making sure that lang is loaded to their R session:\nlibrary(lang)\n\nSys.setenv(LANGUAGE = \"spanish\")\n\n?lang_help\nlang always looks first in the ‘inst/man-lan’ folder of your package to see if there is a folder matching the end-user’s language. If it does not find one, it will then trigger a live translation of the function. This would be the case if the user expect a French translation, but you only included a Spanish one.\nInstead of having the user wait for the LLM to complete the translation, if lang finds a matching translation in your package, the help page will appear almost instantly.\nUnder the hood, lang will use the value of your environment variables to determine which sub-folder to check. If the value of LANG is a full locale value (en_US.UTF8), then it will check in the folder matching the variables first two characters exist. If the value is not a locale, lang will attempt to translate the value into an ISO 639 code. This package contains a small conversion table to do its best to infer the language you are using, and thus to know which sub-folder to look for."

Run multiple ‘Large Language Model’ predictions against a table. The predictions run row-wise over a specified column. It works using a one-shot prompt, along with the current row’s content. The prompt that is used will depend of the type of analysis needed.\nThe README file is very short because all the information about how to use it is this website: https://mlverse.github.io/mall/."
