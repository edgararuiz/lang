## translate_roxygen

## Description
Reads the Roxygen2 tags in the package and translates them. The translations are stored in R scripts. The default location of the new scripts is 'man-lang'. The will be in a sub-folder representing the language the are translated to.


## Usage
```r

translate_roxygen(lang, folder, target = path("man-lang"), source = path("R"))

translate_roxygen_file(path, lang, target_path)
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| lang | The target language to translate help to |
| folder | 2-letter language/source folder to save the new Roxygen scripts to. |
| target | The target base folder to save the Roxygen files. It defaults to 'man-lang'. The final destination will be a combination of this and the folder from `folder` |
| source | The source R scripts. It defaults to the 'R' folder. |
| path | The path to the R script containing the Roxygen help documentation |
| target_path | The path to write the new, translated, R script to. The name of the file will match that of the original R script. |

## Details
This approach makes it easier to edit the translations by hand after the LLM does a first pass. It also allows for others to collaborate with improving the translation.
